These chemicals are associated with a wide array of health issues.\nEndocrine glands, distributed throughout the body, produce the hormones that act as signaling molecules after release into the circulatory system. The human body is dependent on hormones for a healthy endocrine system, which controls many biological processes like normal growth, fertility, and reproduction. Hormones act in extremely small amounts, and minor disruptions in those levels may cause significant developmental and biological effects.\nEndocrine disruptors are found in many everyday products, including some cosmetics, food and beverage packaging, toys, carpet, and pesticides. Some chemicals that act as flame retardants may also be endocrine disruptors. Contact with these chemicals may occur through air, diet, skin, and water. EDCs cannot be completely avoided or removed; however, you can make informed choices to reduce exposure and risk of any potential health effects.\nAccording to the Endocrine Society, there are nearly 85,000 human-made chemicals in the world, and 1,000 or more of those could be endocrine disruptors, based on their unique properties.\u00a0 The following are among the most common and well-studied.\nPeople may be exposed to endocrine disruptors through food and beverages consumed, pesticides applied, and cosmetics used. In essence, your contact with these chemicals may occur through diet, air, skin, and water.\nEven low doses of endocrine-disrupting chemicals may be unsafe. The body\u2019s normal endocrine functioning involves very small changes in hormone levels, yet we know even these small changes can cause significant developmental and biological effects. This observation leads scientists to think that endocrine-disrupting chemical exposures, even at low amounts, can alter the body\u2019s sensitive systems and lead to health problems.\n\u00a0\nFor more than three decades, NIEHS has been a pioneer in conducting research on the health effects of endocrine disruptors. NIEHS-supported research leads to a greater understanding of how endocrine-disrupting chemicals may harm our health and cause disease.\nThis work began with studies on the endocrine-disrupting effects of the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES). From 1940s through 1970s, DES was used to treat women with high-risk pregnancies, with the mistaken belief that it prevented miscarriage. In 1972, prenatal exposure to DES was linked to the development of a rare form of vaginal cancer in daughters whose mothers took DES, and with numerous noncancerous changes in both sons and daughters. NIEHS experiments on DES successfully replicated and predicted health problems, which was useful in discovering how DES may harm wellbeing.\nNIEHS was involved in developing a consensus statement in 2019 on the key characteristics of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, which provides a framework to help scientists evaluate potential endocrine disruptors.\nNIEHS leads cutting-edge research projects on endocrine disrupting chemicals to understand how they work and define their role in health and disease. Research areas in progress include:\nIn 2000, an independent panel of experts convened by NIEHS and the National Toxicology Program (NTP), which is housed at NIEHS, concluded there was credible evidence that very low doses of some hormone-like chemicals can adversely affect bodily functions in test animals.\nNTP is evaluating endocrine disrupters including\u00a0pesticides, perfluorinated chemicals, compounds that may replace BPA in the marketplace, and components of flame-retardants for how they may affect body tissues such as breast, uterus, fat cells, male reproductive tract, and liver. In addition, they conduct laboratory studies that help them prioritize endocrine disrupting chemicals for further toxicity testing.\nNTP scientists collaborate with researchers from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop and validate integrated, high throughput testing strategies\u00a0to detect substances that could disrupt endocrine functions by interacting with the hormones estrogen and androgen. In addition, they created a comprehensive database from thousands of scientific studies on how different substances interact with hormones.\nThe multi-agency Tox 21\u00a0program, in which NIEHS participates, is developing and applying new models and tools using robotics to predict endocrine disrupting activity for environmental substances.\nNIEHS-supported research has discovered links between endocrine-disrupting chemicals and the ways in which wellbeing may be harmed, as shown by the following examples:\nThis content is available to use on your website.\n"}, {"topic": "Phthalates are known to interfere with the body\u2019s mechanism for hormone production, known as the endocrine system, and they are \u201clinked with developmental, reproductive, brain, immune, and other problems,\u201d according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.", "text": "Show\u00a0all\n\u00a9 2025 Cable News Network.

As the potential consequences of human exposure to phthalates have raised concerns in the general population, they have been studied in susceptible subjects such as pregnant women, infants and children. This article aims at evaluating the impact of exposure to phthalates on reproductive outcomes and children health by reviewing most recent published literature. Epidemiological studies focusing on exposure to phthalates and pregnancy outcome, genital development, semen quality, precocious puberty, thyroid function, respiratory symptoms and neurodevelopment in children for the last ten years were identified by a search of the PubMed, Medline, Ebsco, Agricola and Toxnet literature bases. The results from the presented studies suggest that there are strong and rather consistent indications that phthalates increase the risk of allergy and asthma and have an adverse impact on children\u2019s neurodevelopment reflected by quality of alertness among girls, decreased (less masculine) composite score in boys and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Results of few studies demonstrate negative associations between phthalate levels commonly experienced by the public and impaired sperm quality (concentration, morphology, motility). Phthalates negatively impact also on gestational age and head circumference; however, the results of the studies were not consistent. In all the reviewed studies, exposure to phthalates adversely affected the level of reproductive hormones (luteinizing hormone, free testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin), anogenital distance and thyroid function. The urinary le vels of phthalates were significantly higher in the pubertal gynecomastia group, in serum in girls with premature thelarche and in girls with precocious puberty. Epidemiological studies, in spite of their limitations, suggest that phthalates may affect reproductive outcome and children health. Considering the suggested health effects, more epidemiologic data is urgently needed and, in the meantime, precautionary policies must be implemented.\n\n\n\n\n                                        \n                                            This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                    \nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     \n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nKavlock RJ, Daston GP, DeRosa C, Fenner-Crisp P, Gray LE, et al.

It\u2019s been linked to fetal abnormalities, low birth weight, and brain and behavior disorders in infants and children, as well as diabetes, heart disease, cancer and obesity in adults. One study even found erectile dysfunction in workers exposed to BPA.\n    \n\n            Death from any cause may now be added to that list, according to new research published Monday in the journal JAMA Network Open.\n    \n\nRelated article\nNew FDA limits on arsenic levels in infant rice cereals don't adequately protect children, critics say\n\n\n            The new study found people who had higher levels of bisphenol A in their urine were about 49% more likely to die during a 10-year period. \n    \n\n            \u201cThis is another puzzle piece that compellingly speaks to the seriousness of the threat posed by these chemicals used in can linings and thermal papers,\u201d said study author Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director of environmental pediatrics at NYU Langone Health.\n    \n\n            Although this is the first study to find that result, \u201cthis is not necessarily a huge stretch from the perspective of what you might expect to happen because those three conditions \u2013 obesity, diabetes, and heart disease \u2013 all step up the risk of mortality,\u201d Trasande said.\n    \n\n            An industrial chemical that has been around since the 1960s, BPA is used to make polycarbonate plastics \u2013 such as water bottles \u2013  as well as resins used to coat and seal many products. \n    \n\n            BPA and its sister chemicals can be found in beverage containers, the lining of canned foods, dental sealants, compact disks, plastic dinnerware, car parts, impact-resistant safety equipment and many toys, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n    \n\nRelated article\nToxic chemicals from burning fossil fuels poison dolphins and whales on East Coast\n\n\n            Today, the most common method of exposure for people is through food contaminated by the linings of aluminum cans and beverages. The next highest level of exposure is via thermal paper used to create receipts at nearly every store, Trasande said. \n    \n\n            \u201cDefinitely saying no to that thermal paper receipt is a straightforward way to avoid exposure.\u201d he said. \n    \n\n            It\u2019s especially important to understand the risk of exposure during the pandemic, he added, because studies have shown that using hand sanitizer is a key gateway for the chemicals to absorb into the body.\n    \n\n            \u201cA study found that if you handle these thermal paper receipts and use hand sanitizer, you absorb almost tenfold more bisphenols into your body,\u201d Trasande said. \n    \n\n            Unfortunately, he added, cashiers in stores who use a lot of hand sanitizer are having \u201ca very tough time in the context of the pandemic.\u201d\n    \n\nRelated article\nThe FDA's list of dangerous hand sanitizers has now grown to more than 100\n\n\n            They\u2019re generally wearing gloves these days, so that reduces their exposure, all things considered,\u201d Trasande noted. \u201cBut in an ideal world, we would go all electronic or shift back to old school papers.\u201d\n    \n\n            The US Food and Drug Administration believes that, based on current research, the levels of BPA in foods are \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d or what is known in regulatory jargon as \u201cGRAS.\u201d \n    \n\n            The FDA says the National Toxicology Program continues to stay on top of research into potential harms. \n    \n\n            In 2010, the group found \u201csome concern\u2019 about the impact on fetuses, infants and children\u2019s brain and behavior, as well as on the prostate gland; \u201cminimal concern\u201d when it comes to mammary glands or early puberty; and \u201cnegligible concern\u201d about fetal abnormalities, low birth weight or future reproductive problems.\n    \n\n            However, a recent review found evidence has doubled in the last five years about the negative impact on our health of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in plastics, pesticides, flame retardants and other merchandise.\n    \n\nRelated article\nPlastics and pesticides: Health impacts of synthetic chemicals in US products doubled in last 5 years, study finds\n\n\n            While BPA was only one of those categories, it\u2019s the most studied synthetic chemical, and it\u2019s widely found in human tissue. One study found drinking water from polycarbonate bottles increased BPA levels by two-thirds in just one week. A report by the CDC found levels of BPA in the urine of nearly every American adult. \n    \n\n            The American Chemistry Council, which represents US chemical, plastics and chlorine industries, provided the following statement:\n    \n\n            \u201cBPA is one of the most thoroughly tested chemicals used today and has a safety track record of 50 years, and regulatory bodies around the world have reviewed the science and have found BPA to be safe,\u201d said Jennifer Garfinkel, ACC director of product communications, in a statement.\n    \n\n            \u201cTotal exposure to BPA, from all sources, is extremely low \u2014 about 1,000 times below the safe intake levels set by government bodies in the US,\u201d Garfinkel said.\n    \n\n            \u201cThe American Chemistry Council neglects to consider the ever growing evidence that extremely low levels of exposure can be harmful,\u201d Trasande said in response. \n    \n\n            \u201cFor example the large scale BPA CLARITY study funded by FDA and (National Toxicology Program) found multiple effects at low levels dismissed here as safe,\u201d he added.\n    \n\n            While BPA-free may be seen today on many plastic bottles and containers, environmental and health safety experts say the chemicals that have replaced them may be just as bad.\n    \n\n            That\u2019s because they are still in the same \u201cbisphenol family,\u201d and appear to have the same chemical reaction on the body.\n    \n\n            \u201cI use a twist on the singer Prince to explain it,\u201d Trasande said. \u201cPrince renamed himself as the artist formerly named as Prince. So I call it the artist formerly known as BPA. And there are 40 BPA replacements out there.\u201d\n    \n\nRelated article\nNew FDA limits on arsenic levels in infant rice cereals don't adequately protect children, critics say\n\n\n            Unfortunately for consumers, Trasande added, science must repeat studies on each of those 40 replacements to establish their health effects, even though the body is likely to respond in a similar manner to each.\n    \n\n            \u201cThere\u2019s always a lag, but in the meantime, people continue to be exposed,\u201d Trasante said. \u201cAnd you have to ask yourself how much more do we have to do this before we start regulating chemicals by class?\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cIf you avoid canned food consumption, you avoid the major source of bisphenol exposure,\u201d Trasande said. \n    \n\n            \u201cNow the alternative to canned fruits and vegetables is frozen or fresh fruits and vegetables, and I appreciate there are some accessibility issues during the pandemic, and the existence of food deserts for certain economically disadvantaged groups. That needs to be addressed,\u201d he added.\n    \n\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n    \n\n            Other ways to protect you and your family if you are concerned about exposure to BPA and its sisters include:\n    \n\n            And be assured that a study found just a few days of eliminating BPA-like products from your lifestyle can lower the amount of BPA in your bloodstream.\n    \n\u00a9 2025 Cable News Network.

It\u2019s been linked to fetal abnormalities, low birth weight, and brain and behavior disorders in infants and children, as well as diabetes, heart disease, cancer and obesity in adults. One study even found erectile dysfunction in workers exposed to BPA.\n    \n\n            Death from any cause may now be added to that list, according to new research published Monday in the journal JAMA Network Open.\n    \n\nRelated article\nNew FDA limits on arsenic levels in infant rice cereals don't adequately protect children, critics say\n\n\n            The new study found people who had higher levels of bisphenol A in their urine were about 49% more likely to die during a 10-year period. \n    \n\n            \u201cThis is another puzzle piece that compellingly speaks to the seriousness of the threat posed by these chemicals used in can linings and thermal papers,\u201d said study author Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director of environmental pediatrics at NYU Langone Health.\n    \n\n            Although this is the first study to find that result, \u201cthis is not necessarily a huge stretch from the perspective of what you might expect to happen because those three conditions \u2013 obesity, diabetes, and heart disease \u2013 all step up the risk of mortality,\u201d Trasande said.\n    \n\n            An industrial chemical that has been around since the 1960s, BPA is used to make polycarbonate plastics \u2013 such as water bottles \u2013  as well as resins used to coat and seal many products. \n    \n\n            BPA and its sister chemicals can be found in beverage containers, the lining of canned foods, dental sealants, compact disks, plastic dinnerware, car parts, impact-resistant safety equipment and many toys, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n    \n\nRelated article\nToxic chemicals from burning fossil fuels poison dolphins and whales on East Coast\n\n\n            Today, the most common method of exposure for people is through food contaminated by the linings of aluminum cans and beverages. The next highest level of exposure is via thermal paper used to create receipts at nearly every store, Trasande said. \n    \n\n            \u201cDefinitely saying no to that thermal paper receipt is a straightforward way to avoid exposure.\u201d he said. \n    \n\n            It\u2019s especially important to understand the risk of exposure during the pandemic, he added, because studies have shown that using hand sanitizer is a key gateway for the chemicals to absorb into the body.\n    \n\n            \u201cA study found that if you handle these thermal paper receipts and use hand sanitizer, you absorb almost tenfold more bisphenols into your body,\u201d Trasande said. \n    \n\n            Unfortunately, he added, cashiers in stores who use a lot of hand sanitizer are having \u201ca very tough time in the context of the pandemic.\u201d\n    \n\nRelated article\nThe FDA's list of dangerous hand sanitizers has now grown to more than 100\n\n\n            They\u2019re generally wearing gloves these days, so that reduces their exposure, all things considered,\u201d Trasande noted. \u201cBut in an ideal world, we would go all electronic or shift back to old school papers.\u201d\n    \n\n            The US Food and Drug Administration believes that, based on current research, the levels of BPA in foods are \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d or what is known in regulatory jargon as \u201cGRAS.\u201d \n    \n\n            The FDA says the National Toxicology Program continues to stay on top of research into potential harms. \n    \n\n            In 2010, the group found \u201csome concern\u2019 about the impact on fetuses, infants and children\u2019s brain and behavior, as well as on the prostate gland; \u201cminimal concern\u201d when it comes to mammary glands or early puberty; and \u201cnegligible concern\u201d about fetal abnormalities, low birth weight or future reproductive problems.\n    \n\n            However, a recent review found evidence has doubled in the last five years about the negative impact on our health of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in plastics, pesticides, flame retardants and other merchandise.\n    \n\nRelated article\nPlastics and pesticides: Health impacts of synthetic chemicals in US products doubled in last 5 years, study finds\n\n\n            While BPA was only one of those categories, it\u2019s the most studied synthetic chemical, and it\u2019s widely found in human tissue. One study found drinking water from polycarbonate bottles increased BPA levels by two-thirds in just one week. A report by the CDC found levels of BPA in the urine of nearly every American adult. \n    \n\n            The American Chemistry Council, which represents US chemical, plastics and chlorine industries, provided the following statement:\n    \n\n            \u201cBPA is one of the most thoroughly tested chemicals used today and has a safety track record of 50 years, and regulatory bodies around the world have reviewed the science and have found BPA to be safe,\u201d said Jennifer Garfinkel, ACC director of product communications, in a statement.\n    \n\n            \u201cTotal exposure to BPA, from all sources, is extremely low \u2014 about 1,000 times below the safe intake levels set by government bodies in the US,\u201d Garfinkel said.\n    \n\n            \u201cThe American Chemistry Council neglects to consider the ever growing evidence that extremely low levels of exposure can be harmful,\u201d Trasande said in response. \n    \n\n            \u201cFor example the large scale BPA CLARITY study funded by FDA and (National Toxicology Program) found multiple effects at low levels dismissed here as safe,\u201d he added.\n    \n\n            While BPA-free may be seen today on many plastic bottles and containers, environmental and health safety experts say the chemicals that have replaced them may be just as bad.\n    \n\n            That\u2019s because they are still in the same \u201cbisphenol family,\u201d and appear to have the same chemical reaction on the body.\n    \n\n            \u201cI use a twist on the singer Prince to explain it,\u201d Trasande said. \u201cPrince renamed himself as the artist formerly named as Prince. So I call it the artist formerly known as BPA. And there are 40 BPA replacements out there.\u201d\n    \n\nRelated article\nNew FDA limits on arsenic levels in infant rice cereals don't adequately protect children, critics say\n\n\n            Unfortunately for consumers, Trasande added, science must repeat studies on each of those 40 replacements to establish their health effects, even though the body is likely to respond in a similar manner to each.\n    \n\n            \u201cThere\u2019s always a lag, but in the meantime, people continue to be exposed,\u201d Trasante said. \u201cAnd you have to ask yourself how much more do we have to do this before we start regulating chemicals by class?\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cIf you avoid canned food consumption, you avoid the major source of bisphenol exposure,\u201d Trasande said. \n    \n\n            \u201cNow the alternative to canned fruits and vegetables is frozen or fresh fruits and vegetables, and I appreciate there are some accessibility issues during the pandemic, and the existence of food deserts for certain economically disadvantaged groups. That needs to be addressed,\u201d he added.\n    \n\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n    \n\n            Other ways to protect you and your family if you are concerned about exposure to BPA and its sisters include:\n    \n\n            And be assured that a study found just a few days of eliminating BPA-like products from your lifestyle can lower the amount of BPA in your bloodstream.\n    \n\u00a9 2025 Cable News Network.
